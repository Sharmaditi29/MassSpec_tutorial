Welcome to the MassSpecTutorial!

This repository is your starting point for understanding the basics of mass spectrometry (MS), a powerful tool in the field of proteomics. As I embarked on my PhD journey to explore proteomics and mass spectrometry, I've crafted simple, easy-to-understand code examples to demystify MS. Here’s what you can expect:

- Understanding Mass Spectrometry: Learn why MS is pivotal in scientific research.
- Data Formats: Discover how MS data is stored and how to manipulate these formats.
- Data Visualization: Visualize MS data to enhance understanding and insights.

Effortless Learning: No installation needed! Run the code in Google Colab—a free, web-based platform.

Dive into the examples, run the code, and see real MS data in action. This repository is an evolving space, as I'll continue adding more content throughout my PhD. Ideal for students, researchers, or anyone keen on science, these resources aim to make MS accessible and engaging.

Happy exploring!
