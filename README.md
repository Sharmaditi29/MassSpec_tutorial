Welcome to MassSpecTutorial!

This GitHub repository is all about learning the basics of mass spectrometry (MS). If you're new to this field or just curious about how MS works, you're in the right place. Here, I share easy-to-understand codes that will help you explore:

- What mass spectrometry is: You'll learn about the basics of MS and why it's so useful.
- Different file formats used in MS: There are various ways data can be saved in MS, and I'll show you how to work with these formats.
- How to visualize MS data: Seeing the data visually can help make sense of it. I provide codes that help you create visuals from MS data.

The best part? You don't need to install anything on your computer to run these codes. You can use them directly in a web-based Jupyter notebook called Google Colab. It's free and easy to use.

Feel free to try running the codes, explore the examples, and see how MS data is handled and analyzed. Whether you're a student, a researcher, or just someone interested in science, I hope these codes will make mass spectrometry a bit easier to understand and more accessible.

Happy exploring!
